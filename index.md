# Hi-Fidelity Prototype

This portion of the project was all sorts of up and down. I’ll admit I didn’t reach the final point/view of what I’ve had in mind, but I’m really glad that I was able to come up with what I could. It’s by no means perfect, and I’d even argue I fell short. I was fortunate that most of my improvements and suggestions were derived from the experience itself and not the aesthetic portions. 

I think this experience was able to show that the hi-fidelity prototype is constanlty about iterating and consistent revisions. While it may not be a forever process, it’s a process that takes time to perfect for the best possible user experience for my designated users. I can 100% understand why we did the personas, empathy maps, and the user journeys to determine how users get from point A to B, and depending on what task.

## Edits & Comments

### Suggestions

These aren’t all of them, but more or less these are most of the general points/suggestions made.

**Victoria’s Suggestions:**

- Not sure about the passport icon
- Not sure about the map icon

**Gabriella’s Suggestions:**

- Maybe include some description explaining what the app’s purpose is or how the user should proceed from here
- Would like the achievements to be clickable
- Not sure what “Live” means
    - not resolved due to lack of AR development
- Random people or friends on the journal page
- Date in Journal entry should be editable and not autofill

### Revisions

Most of my revisions were minimal but I think may have benefitted more aesthetically and hopefully as a means to improve user experience too.

This was a slight and last minute change, but the text was a Heading 3 or 4 for the questions and I felt like it was overpowering with it being BIG AND BOLD. As a result, the change was to shrink it down and to have a happier peach color which increased the legibility. I potentially want to reconsider the circles as toggles for the selection, but I hope to find a better layout for these screens if I have the time.

With this, I changed the icons at the bottom, it shows the house for home, but originally was to imitate the passport look. That wasn’t clear as well as the original map icon which looked like a square with a “T”. After changing these icons, my other testers were able to quickly identify what was home and not. On top of that, I removed the logo of the app and replaced it with a “Question Mark” button next to the name. This in turn is meant for people to return to if they get

The differences here is that I removed those odd circles and instead added a “More” button as well as called them “Community Updates”. I know that Gabriella said it would be nice to have friends, but since children are on the app/platform I thought it was best to use a first name basis and just show what people have been up to see what people have been doing. It’s a means of connecting people but not as intimately or in a potentially dangerous way that social media would. This is an educational app, not a social media app. It may be best to move the buttons to the right, instead of DIRECTLY under “Past Entries”. 

### Additions

**Profile**

- Here you’re able to view a sort of full-history of past snapshots, journal entries, and more
- also a sort of achievements home → would be best to add the username

**Map**

- I actually had a hard time finding a good map to reference, but I ended up finding a decent one that let me make pinpoints and so forth!
- With this, I think it’s hard to use if you don’t live in the South Coast Area and it would potentially be nice to see how it looks in a Google Maps format
- Simulataneously it may have been suggested to add a guide/key/legend to differentiate between visited and not have visited yet

**Gallery**

- This kind of mirrors Google Photos and has automatically curated albums (which may not be super clear)
- It also shows a sort of Most Recent → Oldest Photos filter like most albums

**Segerstrom History**

- for those interested in the history right off the bat and would prefer to learn about it, instead of visiting through the places or don’t wish to participate in AR
    - they’re able to do so and filter through it here, as arranged in categories → similar to how it is on the Henry T. Segerstrom site

**Circles**

- This portion may be the least fleshed out and I wish to expand on this further, it’s listed at the bottom as one of the things I hope to improve and further invest in
    - The goal, espcially with AR integrations, is that all users, especially children, are able to detect and abstract-ify circles from the public art pieces they visit
    - Thus they would find a certain number of circles at each location based on those configurations
    - But since that feature itself is not only not fleshed out, but not really in great thought → it fails to show purpose, meaning, and contribution to the app → despite the whole app circling around this idea

**Hands-On Activities**

- I was hoping to showcase a few instances like in the Reclining Figure shot where you can learn while doing activities; but having a separate space like this allows people to get involved before and after visiting
    - what would be nice is to add preview images and other such related imagery that engage and encourage the user to explore more but also to futher ideate what possibilities they can create with these activities/prompts

**Onboarding**

- As per Gabriella’s comments, it was suggested to explain what the app is and what it’s purpose is
- I actually really like making onboarding screens, but it was hard to explain or how to best onboard
    
    → It may be better to onboard with each task or introduce them all, at this time, I’m not too sure but I do know this is a pretty preliminary sort of onboarding process versus a much more in-depth introduction to the app

## Prototyping

### Hi-Fidelity Autoflow

[https://www.figma.com/file/SOdGAE9qKIWelgBPFOdoxR/DH110---Selene?node-id=424%3A3721](https://www.figma.com/file/SOdGAE9qKIWelgBPFOdoxR/DH110---Selene?node-id=424%3A3721)

Upon making my changes and such, I actually learned I had to redo a handful of stuff. Which was fine, but obviously not preferable. I think also the orientation of screens I have may not be clear, but it was nice once I added all the screens. I think I would have preferred doing my full hi-fidelity prototype in ProtoPie to show the cool microinteractions, but just as Professor Cho suggested — it was better to use Figma. 

I think some things took longer than I thought in terms of ideation but also application.

### Cognitive Walkthrough

Edit: I realized I didn’t capture their audio, but fortunately I recall a lot of their suggestions and comments → I also apologize for my audio input methods.

**Ben’s Comments:**

- Not clear for kids, finding circles may be metaphorical
- As long as it works, I like it
- Upon first using an app, I’ll look through the tabs first

**Diego’s Comments:**

- Onboarding should be automatic and not sought out by the user
- Looks through the tabs as well at first upon looking at app
- passport doesn’t give the vibe of a sort of journal, since that’s what the journal may be for instead
- Would be best re-evaluate the circles and make it more integrated into the app

**Pathway to Take a Picture → Not what I thought?**

Their Path: Home → Map → Click Point → Learn about Visited Point → Camera → Confirm Identified Public Art → Tap Face

Ideally: Home → Camera → Confirm Identified Public Art → Tap Face

The use of going to the map first instead of taking the picture immediately was odd to me, but it goes to show that some people want to learn where it is, and maybe even confirm. The question at hand was in fact “Take a picture of the Reclining Figure” versus “Take a picture and learn about it”. This question phrasing may have led to that pathway but I’m sure that was something I didn’t expect nonetheless.

**Pathway to Enter Pre-Visit Entry → Exactly what I thought**

Their Path: From Camera → Journal → New Entry → Pre-Visit Entry

Ideally: Home → Journal → New Entry → Pre-Visit Entry

With a nearly identical path, it went to show that this was easy to navigate and proved to be a simpler and more direct task compared to the previous task. This shows that this path doesn’t need improvement and may even be a good model for other pathways/tasks in this app.

## Conclusion

While I didn’t have as much time to implement all the suggestions, especially towards the end with my cognitive walkthrough, I definitely am learning that this is a never-ending process but there’s also tons of solutions for these issues. My project is by no means perfect, and I think I can further improve it with further testing. I think like most people, I wish I had more time but I’d really like to have done more user testing or even specific flows. I think last week’s use of Maze was smart and may have been better to gauge and I would have properly caught everyone’s opinions, thoughts, and suggestions. 

Nonetheless, I plan to still implement them even if not required for this week’s assignment and other such work. 

### Self-Suggested Improvements, Suggestions, Further Implementations

1. Improve Onboarding
    1. Would be best to be more specific
    2. Automate the experience from the get-go
2. Expand on Finding Circles Logic and Message
    1. This is important to best identify how the name relates to the app
    2. Further develop the AR “tech” and prototype it into this feature, as it’s to be a main “sell-point”
3. Animate and Create Screens for the Passport
    1. The passport is definitely targeted to kids, but to anyone who wants to keepsake their favorite achievements and memories
    2. It would be best to develop and clearly differentiate it from the Journal portion of the app
